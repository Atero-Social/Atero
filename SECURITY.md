# Security Policy

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in Atero (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn't be possible), you can reach us at <security@atero.eu.org>.

You should *not* report such issues on GitHub or in other public spaces, or social networks to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing Atero's users to increased risk.
